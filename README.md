# Atlas de Histología Digital

## Overview

This digital histology atlas is an invaluable educational resource designed specifically for medical students, healthcare professionals, and anyone studying human tissue structures. It features a comprehensive collection of 28 high-quality microscopic images covering all major tissue types and organ systems.

## Educational Value

- **High-Quality Microscopic Images**: Crystal-clear histological slides that showcase detailed tissue structures
- **Interactive Features**: Zoom capabilities for detailed examination of cellular structures
- **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Each slide includes detailed descriptions in Spanish, explaining key features and characteristics
- **Systematic Organization**: Organized progression from basic tissue types to complex organ systems

## Featured Tissue Types

The atlas covers essential tissue categories including:

- Epithelial tissues (simple and stratified)
